# HashCracker - Dictionary Attack Script

HashCracker is a Python-based tool designed to simulate dictionary attacks on passwords. It supports both plain-text and hashed password matching using various hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA256). The tool is multithreaded for efficient password cracking.

## Features
- Supports plain-text and hashed password matching.
- Compatible with multiple hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.).
- Multithreaded for faster password attempts.
- Logs all attempts to a file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- `hashlib` module (pre-installed in Python)
